            An intro to the world of photography:
           Photography is the art and practice of capturing moments, emotions, and stories using light. It allows people to freeze time and preserve memories that might otherwise be forgotten. Through photography, ordinary scenes like a busy street, a smiling face, or a calm sunset can become powerful visual messages. A photographer uses elements such as light, composition, color, and timing to guide the viewer’s eye and create meaning in an image. Beyond being a creative skill, photography is also a form of communication, used in journalism, science, marketing, and personal expression. It helps document history, raise awareness about social issues, and show different perspectives of the world. With modern digital cameras and smartphones, photography has become more accessible, allowing almost anyone to tell their story visually. Despite the technology, the true strength of photography lies in the photographer’s ability to observe, feel, and capture the right moment with intention and clarity.

            What is photography  about :
           Photography is all about using light to create meaningful images that tell stories, express emotions, and capture reality or imagination. At its core, it involves observing the world carefully and choosing the right moment, angle, and composition to record a scene. Photography combines technical skills, such as controlling exposure, focus, and lighting, with creativity and personal vision. It can be used to document real-life events, showcase beauty, communicate ideas, or preserve memories for the future. Whether it is portrait, landscape, wildlife, fashion, or documentary photography, each type serves a purpose and delivers a message. Photography is also about perspective, showing how different people see the same subject in unique ways. With the growth of digital technology, photography has become more accessible, but its true value still lies in the photographer’s ability to see, feel, and capture moments that matter.

            Fun facts about photography:
            Photography has many fun and surprising facts that make it more interesting than most people realize. The first photograph ever taken required an exposure time of several hours, unlike today where images are captured in a fraction of a second. The word photography comes from Greek words meaning “drawing with light,” which perfectly explains what it is all about. Early cameras were so large that they could not be carried easily, while modern smartphones can take millions of photos and fit in a pocket. Another fun fact is that the human eye can see a wider range of light than most cameras, which is why photographers use editing to recreate what they truly saw. The most photographed subject in the world is believed to be the moon. Also, the first color photograph was taken in the 1860s, long before digital cameras existed, showing that photography has always been evolving.

    <P><strong>A gist on my photography journey</strong></P>
   <div>
     <P>
My journey with photography <em> began as simple curiosity and slowly grew into a deep passion</em>. At first, I captured anything that caught my eye, learning through mistakes and experimenting with light, angles, and composition. Over time, photography taught me patience and attention to detail, helping me see beauty in ordinary moments. Each photo became a lesson, whether it was understanding natural light or telling a stronger visual story. As my skills improved, I started using photography to express emotions and share perspectives that words could not fully explain. Photography also connected me with people, places, and experiences I might have overlooked. Today, it is more than a hobby; it is a way I document my growth, creativity, and view of the world.
